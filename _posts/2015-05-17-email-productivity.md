How to write effective emails and email productivity tips/tools.  Being a partially hearing disabled person, I’ve been using emails as primary source of communication for some time now. I get a lot of emails and write even more, here is what I’ve learned from them about writing effective emails. 

A Typical Email — 3 paragraphs —  3lines each  


Introduction 
Content 
Call for action 

Introduction  Give a brief introduction about why you are writing this email. If you are writing a cold email, briefly introduce yourself along with why you write, brevity is the key. Maximum allowed is 3 lines. 2 is perfect. Never write stories. 

Content The main content of the email. Again, brevity is the key. Never write stories.

Call for Action Always end your emails with a call for action to the recipient. It should be clear as to what he should do next. 

Tools There are various email productivity tools, here are a few that I use personally. 

Rapportive and Vibe — to know all about the person behind the email.Rapportive and Vibe app lets you know connected accounts to a particular email from all over the web. This can be particularly helpful when reaching out to someone you don’t know personally. Rapportive works as chrome extension while vibeapp as a standalone app available for all platforms.
Yesware — for email tracking.  
Followupthen —  for scheduling follow-ups. If you are writing to a busy person, there are chances you don’t get a reply right away. It’s always good to follow-up on email. Followupthen helps to manage this. You can email a bcc to say — 2days@followupthen.com to schedule a followup along with the original email.
