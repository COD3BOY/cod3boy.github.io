				2010 — I lost about 80% of hearing.
2011 — Rejected for jobs because I can’t get on client calls.
2012 — Got a job paying $120 a month to learn and do a development job.
2013–2015 — more learning, job, startup.
2016 — Job offer for $120,000 which was rejected and went on to build my own company.
I got a full scholarship at Draper University, met some of the most helpful people in my life and that’s how I went on to build my company in Silicon Valley.
